        My name is Destiny Ratsavong. I am currently a senior at The Ohio State University studying biology. I am also a student in OSU's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I am an avid reader and I enjoy reading myster and thriller novels. I also love to do things that express my creativity such as painting, knitting, sewing, pottery and plenty more.
